# node-sgp4

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joshuaferrara/node-sgp4.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joshuaferrara/node-sgp4)

SGP4 is one of five simplified pertubation models used to calculate various orbital information about satellites. This library was ported from python-sgp4 and uses some functions from satellite-js to convert coordinates.

### Installation
`npm install sgp4`
### Example | [Google Maps Demo](http://tracking.ferrara.space/)
An example is provided in the top directory named `example.js`. To run the example, simply use the command `node example`. This example program will print the latitude and longitude of the ISS at the current point in time based off of TLE data from 14 September 2015.
### Notes
Most of the methods are self explanatory. The example does a great job of showing how to get different types of coordinates. There are many functions at the bottom of sgp4.js that allow conversion between different coordinate models.
